# Nerd Alert - Front end

Nerd Alert is for all the people who love to play computer/video games and that want a community where they can find likeminded people. Loggged in users can share pictures from their favourite game or why not movie and rate, comment on other peoples posts.

### Site Goals

Nerd Alert is for all the nerdy people out there who wants to find likeminded people to share their love for nerdy things. The main category is computer/video games but people can also share a movie related to a specific video game, or why not a 3D printed stand for your gaming controllers that reminds you of Zelda. Maybe you want help to find the next game to play? A movie for the geek night with your friends? Or help to find the best headset for your gaming computer? Only your imagination sets the limits of what you want to share.

### Agile Planning

I used a kanban board when developing this project to help me track each of the steps I needed to take to complete this website.

During the development of the webpage I deleted all the stories I found not necessary to keep in the webise so I only could focus on the ones I really needed.

The Kanban board was created using github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/Kimskogfelter/projects/6/views/1).

### Design

#### Colour-Scheme

The background color on the navigation menu is #243837 to make the icons and logo pop. 
The font and icons colors are a mix between #FE7833 and black to have a nice mix of colors on the website.
The posts, forms and followers profiles backgrounds are white. 
The background color on the website is light grey so that the posts, forms and followers profiles stands out a bit from the background.

#### Typography

The main font used on the website is "DM Sans".
